 # JavaScript Exercises

 These exercises are practice material I've found helpful when reviewing the fundamentals of JavaScript. They are taken directly from Code With Mosh's Complete Mastery of JavaScript series, which I highly recommend. I do not own the code used in these exercises, and acheived these solutions both through my own practice and through studying the courses' given solutions.
